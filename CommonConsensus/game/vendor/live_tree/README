= LiveTree - Tree widget that loads data asynchronously as-needed

Home page: http://www.epiphyte.ca/code/live_tree.html

LiveTree implements a JavaScript/DHTML tree widget that loads data asynchronously as-needed (using AJAX[http://www.adaptivepath.com/publications/essays/archives/000385.php]).
This makes it ideal for cases where the dataset is too large to load to the browser all at once.
Data can be provided in the HTML page as well, in which case no asynchronous loading is needed, 
making this widget suitable for standalone client-side use.

LiveTree consists of two components: client-side JavaScript code that runs in the user's browser 
which displays and allows the user to navigate the tree, and a server component that
provides data to the client.  
The client-server protocol is very simple, which means server
components can be easily created for just about any web server configuration with minimal effort.
Presently, the only existing server component is for Ruby On Rails.  The rest of this document
specifically addresses using LiveTree with Ruby On Rails.

The client-side JavaScript component is documented here[link:files/LiveTreeClient.html].

See STATUS[link:files/STATUS.html] for LiveTree's current development status.

== Setup

1. Untar/zip the distribution into your rails application directory.  It will create the following:

   * <tt>README.live_tree</tt> - small note that points to this file
   * <tt>vendor/live_tree/*</tt> - ruby on rails code
   * <tt>vendor/live_tree/doc/*</tt> - this documentation
   * <tt>public/images/live_tree*.gif</tt> - images
   * <tt>public/stylesheets/live_tree.css</tt> - stylesheet
   * <tt>public/javascripts/live_tree.js</tt> - JavaScript

2. Add to app/controllers/application.rb:

	require "live_tree/live_tree.rb"	
	class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
		include LiveTree
		helper LiveTreeHelper
	end

   This will make LiveTree available to your whole application.  
   If you only want it to be available to a particular controller, add it to that controller instead.

== Getting Started

This section will walk you through setting up a tree.

=== Model

LiveTree gets your data from an ActiveRecord model object which acts as a tree.  For the sake of efficiency, you
should also have your model use a counter cache.

For example (in <tt>app/models/person.rb</tt>):

	class Person < ActiveRecord::Base
		acts_as_tree :order => "name", :counter_cache => true
	end
	
and the table definition:

	CREATE TABLE people (
		id INT(11) NOT NULL AUTO_INCREMENT,
		parent_id INT(11) DEFAULT NULL,
		name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL DEFAULT '',
		children_count INT(11) NOT NULL DEFAULT 0,
		PRIMARY KEY (id)
	);
	
If you wish to serve data that does not come from an ActiveRecord model, simply use an object that has a +children+ and a +parent+ method.

=== Controller

A controller is used to serve data to the client.  The simplest way to set up your controller is as follows (in <tt>app/controllers/family_tree_controller.rb</tt>):

	class FamilyController < ApplicationController		
		live_tree :family_tree, :model => :person	
		def show_tree
			@root = Person.find(params[:id]);
		end
	end

The LiveTree::ClassMethods.live_tree class method sets up your controller to serve data to the client.

By default, it gets a data item's name using the model object's +name+ property.
You can change that using the <tt>:get_item_name_proc</tt> option.
Also note that the LiveTree does not escape HTML special characters in item names, so your names can
contain HTML formatting and special characters (and if this is not desirable, you must use the <tt>:get_item_name_proc</tt> option to escape the name).

The <tt>show_tree</tt> action defined in the example reads the specified person from the database, which will be the root (top) of the displayed family tree, for use by the view.

=== View

Finally, the view displays the tree (in <tt>app/views/family/show_tree.rhtml</tt>):

	<div style="width:300px;height:415px">		
		<%= live_tree(:family_tree, {
			:initial_data_root => @root,
			:on_click_item => "alert('You clicked on ' + item.name)",			
		}) %>
	</div>
	
The LiveTree::LiveTreeHelper.live_tree helper method displays the tree.  
The <tt>:initial_data_root</tt> option specifies the top item of the tree.
Since the tree by default expands in size to fill the element it is in,
we wrap it in a div that has a specified width and height.

You will also need to include the LiveTree JavaScript and stylesheet in your page's HEAD section, 
as well as the Prototype JavaScript (which is bundled with rails):

	<html>
		<head>
			...
			<%= stylesheet_link_tag('live_tree') %>	
			<%= javascript_include_tag "prototype" %>
			<%= javascript_include_tag "live_tree" %>
			...
		</head>		
		...
	</html>


Now if you start rails and browse to http://localhost:3000/family/show_tree/1, it will display the family tree, with the person whose database ID is 1 at the top.
